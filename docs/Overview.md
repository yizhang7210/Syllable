# Syllable Overview


### Background
Syllable was first inspired by my personal desire for an organized place to store
and review my everyday learnings from reading and talking to people.

It took its current form of a `knowledge catalogue` after I started working at a
decent size company and realized that many people had their personal stash of
knowledge in the form of hidden links, magic scripts and so on, which could really
benefit their fellow colleagues. But everyone kept them in a different place and
these are not easily shareable.

Thus born Syllable. A simple, searchable, and shareable knowledge catalogue that
makes you never lose track of knowledge again.


### Influence
The design of Syllable was inspired by many products:
- Some general UI elements are borrowed from `Google Keep`.
- Script sharing is inspired by `GitHub gists`.
- A size limit on Grips comes from the same restriction on `Twitter`.
- The voting functionality is inspired by `StackOverflow`.


### Target Market
The market opportunity of Syllable primarily reside in fast growing,
small-to-medium businesses.

As companies (or departments of companies) reach ~20-50 people, many of them
start to struggle with keeping everybody in sync, in terms of project status,
company initiative, as well as domain knowledge, and historical context.

This is typically the phase where many companies turn to external tools for a
uniform solution. Project management, HR, incident management, knowledge base,
customer support are among the popular tools that are implemented in this
phase.

When the organization reaches ~100-200 people. The growing pain hits again, where
the individual systems acquire their own sources of truth and the organizational
knowledge becomes more fragmented. It becomes even harder for new joiners to
figure out where things are.

This is where Syllable comes in.

Syllable is the entry point to all of your organizational knowledge.
