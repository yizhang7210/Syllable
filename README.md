# Syllable
The Predictions Exchange

### What is Syllable?

Syllable is an online exchange for predictions.

Just like you can buy and sell company stocks on a stock exchange, you can buy
and sell **Statements of Prediction (SOPs)** on Syllable. Not only that, you can
even create your own SOPs here!

Say you think it'll rain in Lincoln, Nebraska on 22 Nov, 2022. You can create a
piece of SOP with the given content and an expiry date of 2022-11-22. This SOP
can then be traded for profit immediately!

### How does it work?
- When you create an account, you get some amount of virtual currency to
start with. One unit is named one Riemann (RIN), after the mathematician.
- When you create an SOP, you can immediately offer to sell it at any price by placing an "offer" on Syllable.
- Anyone can also place a "bid" on any SOP at any price at any time.
- If a bid and an offer match, a transaction on an SOP will happen, just like in
a stock exchange.
- At the time of expiry, an SOP will cease trading. The owner of the SOP will be credited the amount of RIN equal to the latest transaction price to his/her
balance. Meanwhile, the said SOP will belong to the owner permanently.

### What's the point?
Try to earn as many RINs and own as many correct predictions as possible.
